## 📌 General Expectations

- The project accounts for **25% of your final grade**.
- You are expected to invest significant time and effort.
- Submit the following:
  - ✅ **Detailed and Comprehensive Report (Minimum 10 pages, No Upper Limit)**
  - ✅ **Detailed and Commented Code**
- Your report must describe:
  - What you attempted
  - What worked and what didn’t
  - What you learned
- Please try to make your project **stand out**. The projects that get the highest score are the ones that have taken extra effort in their report and code.

## 📌 Grading Guidelines
If you follow the checklist below for the project, you will get 80% of the project grades. The rest 20% is reserved for truly outstanding projects that stand out. Please include the checklist below in your final report (you can add it in the beginning of the report) along with evidence (e.g., page numbers where you have highlighted a specific aspect, e.g., EDA).

## 🔍 Project Type 1: ML Problem & Solution

**Goal:** Pose a real-world problem as an ML task (classification, regression, clustering), train models, and evaluate.

### ✅ Checklist

- [ ] Choose a **high-quality dataset** (from sources like Kaggle, UCI, OpenML, etc.). Include a section in the report on the dataset and its characteristics.
- [ ] Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Size of the dataset, number of features/instances, etc.
  - Correlations between features and target
  - Feature distributions and label histograms
  - Missing values and imputation strategy
  - Feature variance and standardization
  - Class imbalance analysis
  - Add TSNE or PCA visualization to visualize features and data to understand aspects like separability and so on.
- [ ] If applicable, please perform **comprehensive feature engineering and feature selection** to identify the best features for your task. Look into different feature transformations (e.g., polynomial, categorical, count based, and so on).
- [ ] Apply and compare **multiple ML models**:
  - Linear models (SVMs/Logistic/Linear Regression)
  - Tree-based models (Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost)
  - Neural Networks (MLPs or CNNs if relevant)
- [ ] Conduct **extensive hyperparameter tuning**:
  - Grid search / Random search / Bayesian optimization
  - Use of validation set or cross-validation
- [ ] Provide **reasoning for hyperparameter choices**
- [ ] Use **appropriate evaluation metrics**:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC, RMSE, etc.
- [ ] Include **visualizations** of results (confusion matrices, ROC curves, etc.)
- [ ] Analyze and explain **what works and what doesn't**
- [ ] Discuss **limitations** and future directions
- [ ] Summarize **lessons learned and key takeaways**

## 📚 Project Type 2: Deep Dive into an ML Topic

**Goal:** Explore a specific ML concept deeper than class material.

### ✅ Checklist

- [ ] Select a **focused topic** (e.g., SVMs, Clustering, Regularization, Kernel Methods, Neural Networks)
- [ ] Perform a **thorough literature review**
- [ ] Go **beyond class coverage**, e.g.:
  - For SVMs:
    - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
    - Various kernel methods (RBF, polynomial, string kernels)
    - Outlier detection using SVMs
- [ ] Include **mathematical derivations or conceptual illustrations**
- [ ] Implement **case studies or experiments** to support your findings
- [ ] Present **comparisons of variants/approaches**
- [ ] Include **visualizations** to explain concepts
- [ ] Highlight **novel insights or surprises** from your exploration
- [ ] Clearly summarize:
  - What’s new
  - What you learned
  - How it connects to the course

## 🛠️ Project Type 3: ML Implementation from Scratch

**Goal:** Implement a **family of algorithms** from scratch, showcasing deep understanding and design.

### ✅ Checklist

- [ ] Choose a **non-trivial ML family**:
  - Decision Trees & Ensembles
  - Linear Models with Regularization
  - Neural Networks (basic or CNNs)
  - Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN)
- [ ] Implement:
  - **Multiple variants** within the family
  - **Different objective functions**, heuristics, or loss functions
  - **Key design choices** (e.g., split criteria, regularizers)
- [ ] Add **regression + classification versions**, where applicable
- [ ] (Optional) Build a **mini library or framework**
- [ ] Validate implementation on **multiple datasets**
- [ ] Include **tests and correctness checks** (compare with sklearn, etc.)
- [ ] Use **clear visualizations** (e.g., tree diagrams, decision boundaries)
- [ ] Discuss:
  - Computational cost
  - Strengths and weaknesses
  - Comparisons with existing libraries
- [ ] Document **code extensively**

## ❌ What NOT to Do

- ❌ Avoid **complex research topics** outside course scope (e.g., Transformers, GANs)
- ❌ Don’t submit **simple assignments** disguised as a project (e.g., plain linear regression)
- ❌ Avoid **last-minute work** – effort will reflect in your results
- ❌ Don’t rely solely on **ChatGPT or prebuilt code** – be original and hands-on
